## 📈 Oasis App

Is a Web-application to manage (**Booking**, **cabins** and **guests**) about "THE WILD OASIS" hotel. It is an internal application used inside the hotel to check-in guests as they arrive. I built the side project for learning purposes. The app is not responsive. I mainly focused on the functionalities since I already have plenty of projects that are responsive.
